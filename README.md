# What-and-Where-are-the-World-s-Oldest-Businesses
## Overview:

In this project, we will be exploring a dataset compiled by BusinessFinancing.co.uk that contains information on the oldest companies in (almost) every country that are still in business. The dataset includes three tables: categories, countries, and businesses.

## Our main objectives are:

Finding the oldest company in each country.
Analyzing the distribution of oldest companies by continent and business category.
Visualizing the oldest companies on a world map.
## Tools and Technologies:

We will be using the following tools and technologies for this project:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
- Basemap library
## Results:

Through our analysis, we were able to identify the oldest company in each country and observe the distribution of oldest companies by continent and business category. We also created a world map visualization showing the locations of the oldest companies.

## Conclusion:

Analyzing the oldest companies in the world can provide valuable insights into how businesses can survive changing market conditions and plan for the future. By exploring this dataset, we were able to gain insights into the longevity of businesses in different regions and industries. This information can be useful for entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers who are interested in understanding the factors that contribute to business success and longevity.
